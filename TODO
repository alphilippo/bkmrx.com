TODO

- infinite scroll for bkmrx page
- multi tag filtering
- Implement integration for other third party services such as Facebook, Readability, etc
- Prettify profile pages
- Implement 'follow' function
- Move away from default bootstrap theme
- Allow users to set a default privacy setting for all imported bookmarks
- improved usability
- use # to search for tags in search results - ie #twis etc
- add site: operator
- addons - ie people can create plugins (ie metacpan) that plugs in faves from sites of their choice..

- search & browse sub-sets of domains. ie CPAN as a use case - favourite modules/shortcuts etc
- could we do bundles? Ie Bundles of links to form concepts; could be done automatically by defining related tags, or manually by just say adding a bunch of links and saying 'these are related to a concept, ie bkmrx design ideas'
- don't want to overload with 'features' as need to remain simple, but think about how it's displayed

DB Changes to make a better site:

- store all bkmrx data in ES, worry less about duplication
 -- url, plain text content, screengrab, etc
- user data can be still mongod for now

Cool features:

- popular sites extensions; ie slide previews from slideshare etc?
